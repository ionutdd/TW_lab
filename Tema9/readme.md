Web Application for Posting Pictures

This web application allows users to post pictures and view all the posted pictures. The application includes two pages: a page to display all the posted pictures and a page to upload a new picture. The rendering of these pages is done using EJS, and a partial template is used to generate the list of pictures.

Each post includes a title, a picture, and an optional description. All the posts are saved in JSON files, with one file for each post.
